## Project Files

- `u.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook for this project.
- `GDP and Number of Billionaires.ipynb`: Analysis on GDP and Number of Billionaires, identifying outliers and trends.
- `Exploratory Factor Analysis.ipynb`: Exploration of the number of features using various methods like scree plots and hypothesis testing.
- `Streamlit App`: Development of a Streamlit application for predictions of Net Worth and more.

## Ideas and Tasks

- Analyze the difference between models with and without GDP as a feature.
- Conduct hypothesis tests to determine the impact of GDP on predictions.
- Compare data from 2010 or 2013 with 2023 to identify trends.
- Investigate the relationship between economic distribution and extreme wealth.
- Explore real-time trends from 2001 to 2003.
- Analyze the top 5 billionaires' trends per month.
- Examine which industries have the highest number of billionaires and their trends.
- Visualize data using X, Y, and Z axes to represent industry categories, billionaire counts, and total net worth.
- Investigate the impact of COVID-19 on different countries.
- Add tasks and to-dos for the project.
