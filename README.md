This repository contains the LaTeX source code and data analysis for the research project titled "Billionaire Wealth Dynamics: A Comparative Analysis of Industry, Gender, Inheritance, and Country Factors." The project was submitted for Data Literacy project..

## Overview

Our study delves into the dynamics of billionaire wealth accumulation. Using data from 2000 to 2023, we explore various dimensions such as industry affiliation, gender, inheritance, and the influence of country-specific factors on the distribution of billionaire wealth. The research is pivotal in understanding economic disparities and informing policy decisions.

## Data Sources & Technology

The primary data source is the Forbes Billionaires list, capturing detailed information on billionaires' net worth, industry, gender, and country of residence. Two key datasets are used:

- [Forbes Billionaires Evolution (1997-2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/forbes-billionaires-1997-2023)

- [Billionaires Statistics Dataset (2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/billionaires-statistics-dataset/data)

Analysis is made by using Python and Jupyter Noteboo. Python above version 3 and Jupyter Notebook installion is required. Also following packages has been utilized in the analysis pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, mplcyberpunk, geopandas, numpy, mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1, matplotlib.ticker, squarify, datetime, ast, Tueplots.

## Methodology

Our analysis employs time series analysis and bootstrap resampling techniques to assess:

- Evolution of billionaire wealth over time.
- Gender disparities among billionaires.
- Comparison of self-made versus inherited wealth.
- Impact of country-specific factors.
