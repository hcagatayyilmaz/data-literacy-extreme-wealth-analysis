This repository contains data analysis for the research project titled "Billionaire Wealth Dynamics: A Comparative Analysis of Industry, Gender, Inheritance, and Country Factors." The project was submitted as the Data Literacy project.

## Overview

Our study delves into the dynamics of billionaire wealth accumulation. Using data from 2000 to 2023, we explore various dimensions such as industry affiliation, gender, inheritance, and the influence of country-specific factors on the distribution of billionaire wealth. The research is pivotal in understanding economic disparities and informing policy decisions.
